## 📖 Introduction

**BookLibrary** is a comprehensive library management and delivery system designed to bridge the gap between physical libraries and readers. It revolutionizes the traditional library experience by allowing users to borrow books online and have them delivered directly to their doorstep, eliminating the need for physical visits.

The platform features a robust **multi-role ecosystem** (User, Librarian, Admin) where librarians can manage their catalog, users can track orders in real-time, and admins maintain system integrity.
